  "description": "The `headers` attribute gives authors a way to override implicit cell headers (via `<th>` elements) to accurately describe the structure of complex tables to assistive technology. Note: this is a difficult feature to test, as implicit headers often interfere with results. It's not possible to tell where the header originitated from when testing with an assistive technology; is this header sourced implicitly (via `<th>` elements) or explicitly (via the `headers` attribute). Most real world tables that require the `headers` attribute also make use of implicit headers. Several tests are included for this feature because of this, and some of the results may be false negatives.",
